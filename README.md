# Exchanger App
Currency Converter App

I have build this app for the sake of JS practise. It uses Fixer.io free version API for corrency rates. The API only provides the latest rates, does not convert from currency type to other.
The conversion features is built inside the App, So ultimately it was a good challenge. 

Please avoid using my API key because, I have disabled it. You can get your own at Fixer.io for free of cost.
